# Pose Detector for Interactive and Stylish Particle Effect

🔍 This repository contains a pose detector that uses ML5.js to create an interactive and stylish particle effect. The detector uses a webcam to detect the user's pose in real-time and creates a particle effect around their body.

🚀 To run this project, you'll need to launch the HTML file using a live server. You can do this by using an extension in your preferred code editor, such as Live Server for VSCode.

🔧 To customize the particle effect, you can modify the parameters in the script.js file. This file contains the logic for creating and updating the particles, as well as the code for the pose detection using ML5.js.

📦 This project requires the ML5.js library, which is included as a dependency in the index.html file. You'll need to have an internet connection to load this library.

👩‍💻 To use this pose detector in your own project, you can copy the script.js file and modify it to fit your needs. You can also modify the HTML and CSS files to change the appearance of the particle effect.
